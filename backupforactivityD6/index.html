			Welcome to my website.  For this assignment, I have to write three pages of naked HTML and link them together, all while including a bunch of types of HTML elements.
		</p>
		<p>So, without further ado, here are the links to all three pages.  You might call this a nav menu.</p>
		<br/>
		<hr/>
		<br/>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="/index.html">Home</a></li>
			<li><a href="/page1.html">Page1</a></li>
			<li><a href="/page2.html">Page2</a></li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
		<hr/>
		<br/>
		<h2>Nifty, don't you think?</h2>
		<p><strong>I think so too.</strong>  In fact, here is an unordered list of reasons why I think HTML is awesome:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>HTML can be edited in real time.  It doesn't have to be recompiled into an executable, like C++ or some other languages.</li>
			<li>HTML doesn't freak out and entirely break when you make a small mistake.  It just ignores that you were stupid and displays all of the parts of your code that actually do work.</li>
			<li>HTML can be edited with CSS and Javascript, to the point where there are no limits to what you can or cannot do!</li>
		</ul>
